            <h1>Static Website Webring</h1>
            <p>Developing a static website can be difficult at times. You are somewhat limited by what you can do without having access to a back-end server, unless you are willing to rely on JavaScript.</p>
            <p>With that said, static sites can offer a myriad of benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can keep all of your content on a file system instead of in a database.</li>
                <li>Your site will likely perform quicker than it would if every web page had to be rendered by a back-end server.</li>
                <li>Static sites make you think differently about how to publish content on the web.</li>
                <li>And more...</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This webring will automatically create a link between your site and two others on our webring. Whenever someone clicks on the webring on your site, they will see new sites to explore.</p>
            <p>The goal of this webring is to help share what is possible with static websites. We are doing this by creating a way for you to link to other static websites using webrings.</p>
            <h2>How do I join?</h2>
            <p>Joining the Static Website webring is easy. To join, please send an email to <a href="mailto:readers@jamesg.blog">readers@jamesg.blog</a> with the following pieces of information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your name</li>
                <li>Your domain name</li>
                <li>The name of the static site generator you use</li>
                <li>A link to the static site generator you use (optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To join, you <strong>must build your site using a static site generator</strong>. Your generator can be custom-made or built by someone else. Examples of generators include Jekyll, Hugo, and Eleventy.</p>
            <p>After you have been accepted, paste the following code into the footer of your website:</p>
            <pre>
&lt;a href="https://static-site-webring.jamesg.blog/previous"&gt;Previous&lt;/a&gt;
Static Site Webring
&lt;a href="https://static-site-webring.jamesg.blog/next"&gt;Next&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            <p>All members paste two links at the bottom of their website: a forward and backward arrow. When clicked, these links will take you to the next and previous links in the webring, respectively.</p>
            <p>You can leave the webring at any time by removing the webring links from your site.</p>
            <p>The list of webring members is provided on the right-hand side of this web page.</p>
            <h2>Source Code</h2>
